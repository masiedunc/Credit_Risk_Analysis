# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to create and evaluate models that predict credit risk. Credit risk has an unbalanced classification issue, so finding the right model to predict the risk for a lending company to supply loans. Using supervised learning, we trained and evaluated models and will provide a recommendation on which will best predict credit risk. 

## Results
- Naive Random Oversampling  
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Undersampling method 
- Combination over/under sampling 
  - SMOTEENN  
- Ensemble Learners
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Summary
- There is a summary of the results 
- There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
